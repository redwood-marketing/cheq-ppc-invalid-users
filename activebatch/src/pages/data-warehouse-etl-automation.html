title: ETL Automation and Data Warehouse
description: Simplify your ETL automation and data warehousing with a centralized workload automation and orchestration platform. Connect any endpoint, system or technology.
faqs: 
    What is ETL automation?:
        ETL automation tools enable IT teams to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks without manual intervention. ETL is a data integration process that transfers raw data into a data warehouse or other data system. ETL processes are increasingly complex as data sources become more numerous and diverse. To manage ETL at scale, IT teams must be able to build reliable, automated ETL processes. This can be done with extensible workload automation software that provides automated ETL tasks out of the box.

    What is a data warehouse vs. a database?:
        A database is a collection of structured data stored within a computer system, while a database is a computer system used to perform queries, reporting and analysis. Databases typically support Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), while data warehouses typically support Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) using data from various sources. Workload automation solutions can readily integrate common data warehouse systems, enabling IT to streamline data pipelines across the enterprise.

    Can I automate ETL with workload automation?:
        Yes, you can automate ETL processes with workload automation solutions. Workload automation solutions can provide prebuilt integrations with Big Data platforms, data warehouse systems and more while simplifying the creation of REST API adapters that allow IT to connect virtually any endpoint. Workload automation solutions such as ActiveBatch provide a centralized control panel for building, monitoring and managing data processes across the enterprise.

        <h2>Orchestrate data warehouse processes end-to-end</h2>
        <p>Ensuring effective day-to-day operations, fostering a positive customer experience and capturing key business intelligence all hinge on having reliable real-time data sources, data integrity and data processing. The magnitude of data and data sources, the proliferation of applications and growing number of cloud-based systems within businesses&rsquo; IT ecosystems make data warehousing even more complex, posing more challenges to strapped IT teams. Many have smartly automated business processes when possible, even on a small scale, with limited functionality.</p>
        <p>Using ad-hoc automation solutions, automation scripts and ETL (extract, transform and load) tools to collect information from applications, siloed systems and external data sources create a fragmented system.</p>
        <p>But, designing end-to-end process orchestration is feasible through automation tools like ActiveBatch by Redwood. IT teams can quickly spin up automation without advanced development skills and become more dynamic for evolving business requirements.</p>
