title: "Prefect Cloud Comparison: Upgrade to Advanced Workload Automation"
description: Learn more about Prefect Cloud Comparison. Discover how upgrading to ActiveBatch provides advanced workload automation, seamless data integration, and efficient resource optimization for modern enterprises.
faqs:
    What is Prefect Cloud?:
        Prefect Cloud is a managed orchestration service provided by Prefect.io that enables data engineers and IT professionals to automate and manage complex data workflows. Users can define, schedule and monitor workflows, known as Prefect flows, through an intuitive Prefect UI or command-line interface (CLI). The platform also offers concurrency controls and work pools to optimize flow runs and ensure high availability of data pipelines.


        Flows can run in various environments, including Docker, AWS, GCP and cloud-run platforms. Prefect Cloud supports service accounts and single sign-on (SSO)for secure access control and API keys for simplified application authentication.
        Prefect&rsquo;s API allows for seamless integration with popular data platforms like Snowflake.

        
        Learn more about ActiveBatch and how your team can <a href="https://www.advsyscon.com/en-us/activebatch/orchestration/workflow-orchestration">orchestrate any workflow</a> in a matter of clicks.
    Why should I consider ActiveBatch over Prefect Cloud?:
        ActiveBatch offers a wider range of capabilities than Prefect Cloud. It&rsquo;s designed for organizations and IT operations teams that want to automate workflows across different business domains rather than just data pipelines. Its comprehensive job scheduling and orchestration features make ActiveBatch suitable for those with the initiative to build a mature ecosystem with consolidated tools and organization-wide visibility.


        Despite its sophistication, ActiveBatch is accessible to all types of users. A library of pre-built job steps and the ability to build custom reusable components using any API make it a more flexible, easy-to-use solution than Prefect.
        
        
        Discover how to <a href="https://www.advsyscon.com/en-us/activebatch">easily orchestrate end-to-end IT and business processes in one platform</a> with low-code/no-code functionality and drag-and-drop design.

    Is it difficult to migrate to ActiveBatch?:
        No, migrating to ActiveBatch is a streamlined process because of Redwood Software&rsquo;s leading support and customer success offerings. While the complexity of your migration depends on your existing infrastructure and understanding the schema of your critical business processes, ActiveBatch&rsquo;s comprehensive documentation and training ensure a seamless move from your current platform.
