    Are WLA solutions extensible?:
        There are workload automation solutions that integrate with virtually any application or technology. This can be accomplished with universal connectors, direct integrations, or through REST APIs and web services. Integrations, APIs and scripts can be turned into reusable jobs for reliable end-to-end processes across on-premises and cloud environments (SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS). ActiveBatch provides extensions for tools like IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and SAP.
        
        Unlike most workload automation, workflow automation and job scheduling tools, ActiveBatch integrates with virtually any cloud platform and operating system (Windows, OS, Linux, UNIX, and more). These numerous integrations support scores of use cases across business and IT functions.
