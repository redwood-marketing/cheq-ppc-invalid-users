faqs:
    What is managed file transfer software?:
        Managed file transfer (MFT) software is a secure file movement application designed to facilitate the seamless exchange of data between systems, organizations and individuals. Unlike traditional file transfer methods such as FTP, MFT offers advanced security, automation and compliance capabilities that make it possible to share critically important data while meeting strict cybersecurity standards.

        Learn more about MFT and <a href="https://www.advsyscon.com/blog/what-is-mft-managed-file-transfer/">why MFT solutions are critical for enterprise information security</a>.

    What is the difference between SFTP and MFT?:
        When it comes to transferring files securely, both managed file transfer (MFT) and secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) are popular options. However, they serve different purposes and cater to different needs. MFT is a comprehensive solution designed to securely and efficiently transfer data. It encompasses advanced features like automation, monitoring, reporting and compliance with regulatory standards. MFT platforms use protocols like SFTP, FTPS, HTTPS and more, making them versatile for various use cases.
        

        SFTP is a file transfer protocol that uses SSH (Secure Shell) to encrypt data during transmission. It is a protocol rather than a complete solution, offering secure file transfer between systems. SFTP is widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness but lacks the advanced features found in MFT solutions.
        

        Learn about the <a href="https://www.advsyscon.com/blog/mft-vs-sftp/">differences between MFT and SFTP</a>, and find out which file transfer protocol is best for your organization.

    Is MFT reliable?:
        'Yes, MFT is highly reliable for businesses and organizations that need secure, efficient and consistent data exchange. MFT systems are specifically designed to address the limitations of traditional file transfer methods, offering advanced features that ensure dependability in critical operations. Some key features that make MFT reliable include: 

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure data transfer:</strong> MFT uses advanced encryption protocols such as SFTP, FTPS and HTTPS to safeguard data during transmission and storage. This prevents unauthorized access and ensures data integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated workflows:</strong> By automating file transfers, MFT eliminates human error and ensures that files are delivered accurately and on time. This reliability is crucial for repetitive or time-sensitive tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Error detection and recovery:</strong> MFT systems detect transfer failures and automatically attempt retries or notify administrators. This minimizes disruptions and ensures that critical files reach their destination.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time monitoring:</strong> MFT provides real-time visibility into file transfer processes. Administrators can track progress, resolve issues promptly and access detailed audit logs for troubleshooting.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with standards:</strong> MFT solutions are built to comply with regulatory standards like GDPR, HIPAA and PCI DSS. This ensures reliability in industries where secure and consistent data handling is mandatory.</li>
            <li><strong>High availability and scalability:</strong> MFT platforms are designed to handle large volumes of data and adapt to the growing needs of organizations. Their robust infrastructure ensures uninterrupted service, even during peak usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Centralized management:</strong> A centralized dashboard simplifies the management of all file transfer activities. This consistency reduces the risk of errors and enhances overall reliability.</li>
        </ul>
        MFT is particularly useful in industries that rely on the integrity and completeness of file transfers while adhering to strict cybersecurity standards, such as healthcare, finance, retail and government.
