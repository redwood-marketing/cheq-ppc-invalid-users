faqs:
    What is IT process automation?:
        IT process automation software allows IT professionals to develop, manage and monitor automated processes from a single dashboard. Typically, these are repetitive, time-consuming routine tasks, like server provisioning and configuration, patch management, user provisioning and access management.


        The benefits are reduced human error, optimized scalability and cost savings.


        With the evolution of IT, distributed IT environments with diverse applications from multiple vendors, along with expansive business operations and numerous processes have led IT teams to seek more than a simple automation solution for manual tasks.


        They want end-to-end workflow automation across the entire enterprise with intelligent process automation and seamless adoption into DevOps processes while still bringing innovation to the customer experience. To ensure initiatives and project  management don’t stall due to IT processes, IT teams want a user interface with role-based permissions, allowing for controlled levels of self-service and on-demand data access for business users. Self-service portals can automate common IT requests, report issues and free up IT resources.

    What are examples of process automation?:
        IT process automation covers a broad spectrum of tasks. Among these are automated workflows for approval processes, task routing and management, which ensure seamless operations from initiation to completion. Metrics tracking and analysis are automated, offering real-time insights into performance and efficiency. Automated data entry and reporting tasks leverage various sources, including databases, to facilitate streamlined reporting and record updates.

Companies can harness the full potential of this workflow automation software to ensure smooth workflow management while greatly enhancing productivity across teams.
