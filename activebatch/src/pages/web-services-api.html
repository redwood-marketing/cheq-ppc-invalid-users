title: Web Services API for ActiveBatch Job Scheduler
description: ActiveBatch Web Services API provides developers a direct approach to invoke ActiveBatch methods to interact with non-ActiveBatch programs and processes.

faqs:
    What is a job scheduler API?:
        A job scheduler API is a programming interface that allows developers to automate and control the scheduling of jobs within a software environment. This type of API enables the creation, management and deletion of jobs. Through endpoints exposed by the API, users can specify job details such as jobname, runtime and the specific automation schema in the request body. Functions typically include running jobs at predetermined times or in response to specified events, managing job retries and overseeing job execution statuses. 
        

        Job scheduler APIs are essential in environments like Google Cloud, where managing and scaling numerous tasks efficiently is crucial. 
        

        Find the right <a href="https://www.advsyscon.com/blog/process-automation-tools/">process automation tool</a> for IT.
    What is an API scheduler?:
        An API scheduler refers to a tool or service that organizes and controls the timing and order of API calls within software applications or between services. It helps to efficiently manage the execution of multiple API requests by scheduling them based on predetermined conditions or dynamic requirements. This tool is especially useful for handling dependencies among tasks and making sure API calls occur at the right moment to maintain system integrity and performance. 
        

        Features of an API scheduler include webhook and callback setup, permissions handling and authentication with API keys to secure communication through headers. 
        

        Discover how to <a href="https://www.advsyscon.com/blog/rest-api-adapter/">rapidly create APIs</a> for reliable end-to-end processes without custom scripting so your team can achieve more faster.
    What is the API specification of a task scheduler?:
        The API specification of a task scheduler outlines the technical details and protocol for interacting with the task scheduling service. This specification includes definitions of available endpoints, supported API calls, data structures and the necessary parameters for each function, such as job ID, jobname and runtime, all formatted in JSON. It also describes how to initiate job execution, manage job states, delete jobs and automate retries through POST requests.
        

        The specification ensures that developers understand authentication requirements, such as API keys and the necessary permissions for making API requests. It might also detail the use of webhooks or callbacks for event-driven job management. Developers can refer to the API reference for detailed documentation and may utilize an SDK to simplify interactions with the API.
    What is the job scheduler process?:
        The job scheduler process involves a series of steps and operations that a job scheduler undertakes to manage and execute scheduled jobs within a system. This process begins with the definition of jobs through an API call where specific details like jobname, runtime and automation schema are specified. The scheduler then stores these configurations and monitors the system clock or listens for defined triggers to start job execution. Throughout the job lifecycle, the scheduler manages tasks such as retry attempts on failure, updating job statuses and invoking callbacks or webhooks as necessary.
        

        This process is crucial for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of automated tasks.
